## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate
### Changed
- [PR#81](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/81) resolved [#80](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/issues/80) by updating `polling` to 0.3.

### Added
- [PR#81](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/81) resolved [#79](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/issues/79) by adding `make_single_crash_event`.

## [0.6.0] - 2023-04-03
### Changed
- [PR#70](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/70) removed `winapi` in favor of embedded bindings.

## [0.5.1] - 2022-11-17
### Fixed
- [PR#64](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/64) fixed compilation for `aarch64-linux-android`. Additional targets were added to CI so they get caught before release.

## [0.5.0] - 2022-11-17
### Added
- [PR#62](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/62) and [PR#63](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/63) added support for handling `SIGABRT` on Windows.

### Fixed
- [PR#62](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/62) changed from using `RtlCaptureContext` on Windows to using `crash_context::capture_context`. This implementation fixes a crash issue due to `winapi` and `windows-sys` having [improper bindings](https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/issues/1044).

### Changed
- [PR#62](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/62) changed from using `RtlCaptureContext` on Windows to using `crash_context::capture_context`. This implementation additionally captures floating point and vector state on `x86_64` unlike `RtlCaptureContext`.

## [0.4.0] - 2022-10-21
### Added
- [PR#60](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/60) resolved [#59](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/issues/59) by adding support for `PR_SET_PTRACER` before invoking the user callback, ensuring that an external process has permissions to perform `ptrace` operations on the crashing process, even if `/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope` is set to restricted (1), as this is the default for most newer distributions.

### Changed
- [PR#60](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/60) bumped `windows-sys` to 0.42.

## [0.3.3] - 2022-07-21
### Added
- [PR#46](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/46) resolved [#33](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/issues/33) by adding support for `EXC_RESOURCE` exceptions. Since not all resource exceptions are fatal, they are checked and only reported to the user callback if they are indeed fatal.
- [PR#47](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/47) resolved [#34](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/issues/34) by adding support for `EXC_GUARD` exceptions.

## [0.3.2] - 2022-07-19
### Fixed
- [PR#38](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/38) resolved [#31](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/issues/31) and [#35](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/issues/35) by adding support for 64-bit codes in the mach exception information, as well as now handling `EXC_CRASH` exceptions.
- [PR#43](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/pull/42) resolved [#42](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/crash-handling/issues/42) by fixing a bug on `aarch64-linux`. Thanks [@sfackler](https://github.com/sfackler)!
