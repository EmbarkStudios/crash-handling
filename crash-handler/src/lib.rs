/// # Safety
///
/// This trait is marked unsafe as care needs to be taken when implementing it
/// due to the [`Self::on_crash`] method being run in a compromised context. In
/// general, it is advised to do as _little_ as possible when handling a
/// crash, with more complicated or dangerous (in a compromised context) code
/// being intialized before the [`CrashHandler`] is installed, or hoisted out to
/// another process entirely.
///
/// ## Linux
///
/// Notably, only a small subset of libc functions are
/// [async signal safe](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal-safety.7.html)
/// and calling non-safe ones can have undefined behavior, including such common
/// ones as `malloc` (especially if using a multi-threaded allocator).
///
/// ## Windows
///
/// Windows [structured exceptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/structured-exception-handling)
/// don't have the a notion similar to signal safety, but it is again recommended
/// to do as little work as possible in response to an exception.
///
/// ## Macos
///
/// Mac uses exception ports (sorry, can't give a good link here since Apple
/// documentation is terrible) which are handled by a thread owned by the
/// exception handler which makes them slightly safer to handle than UNIX signals,
/// but it is again recommended to do as little work as possible.
