/// # Safety
///
/// This trait is marked unsafe as  care needs to be taken when implementing it
/// due to running in a compromised context. Notably, only a small subset of
/// libc functions are [async signal safe](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal-safety.7.html)
/// and calling non-safe ones can have undefined behavior, including such common
/// ones as `malloc` (if using a multi-threaded allocator). In general, it is
/// advised to do as _little_ as possible when handling a signal, with more
/// complicated or dangerous (in a compromised context) code being intialized
/// before the signal handler is installed, or hoisted out to an entirely
/// different sub-process.
